# About me... 👋

# 👋 Hi, I’m Sherry Ferguson

Welcome to my GitHub!

I’m a cross-functional leader with a background in service operations, customer success, and program executio; now re-engaging with my roots in IT systems and tools. My career spans transportation, healthcare, and financial services, where I’ve led large-scale service and product initiatives, supported customer experience programs, and driven digital transformation in complex environments.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on:
- Creating a professional portfolio that highlights my skills in cloud systems, automation, and customer experience tools
- Rewriting and organizing legacy process documents into actionable knowledge bases
- Improving field service operations through data and tech-driven insights

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- AWS Cloud Practitioner (exam coming up!)
- Python and SQL for data analysis and automation
- Git and GitHub best practices
- Agile project management (CAPM candidate)

## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Projects that blend service delivery with tech (CRM integrations, customer portals, dashboarding, etc.)
- Cloud-based tools that improve operations or training
- Cross-functional enablement systems for distributed teams

## 🤔 I’m looking for help with:
- Navigating the transition into more technical roles from a service/ops background
- Building a portfolio that speaks to both tech recruiters and operations leaders

## 💬 Ask me about:
- Scaling customer success programs
- Leading service readiness and field enablement

## ⚡ Fun fact:
If I’m not building something with systems and strategy, I’m probably dreaming up my next coffee-and-wine trailer adventure, working on an app or product idea, or chasing sunshine near the coast 🌞☕🍷
